<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
The 'collections' repository is a portfolio of my various explorations that showcase different technologies and frameworks. The purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for new programmers who are learning to code and want to explore different technologies, as well as serve as a portfolio of my skills and experiences. With these explorations, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency with these technologies and help others learn more about them.

## Services

The 'collections' repository currently includes the following explorations:

- `go-authz` : An authorization service written in Go that provides secure and customizable access control to your applications.
- `express-boilerplate-ts` : An ExpressJS boilerplate that uses TypeScript for improved type safety and developer productivity.
- `all-hail-nextjs` : A full-stack web application built using NextJS, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- `next-three-js` : A simple landing page built using NextJS that incorporates ThreeJS, a popular library for creating 3D graphics on the web.

These explorations showcase different technologies and frameworks, and are designed to provide a reference for new programmers who are learning to code and want to explore different technologies. They also serve as a portfolio of my skills and experiences.
